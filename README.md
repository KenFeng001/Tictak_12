Hi, this is a game made by Zile (Ken). It's another slightly strange version of Tic-Tac-Toe. I made this game during my year 1 and noe I made it available to everyone!

In this game, when a player makes a move on the cell, it determines on which of the 9 main cells the next player can make their move. The ultimate goal is to win the main cell by connecting 3 of them. 

Hope you will enjoy this gameÔºÅ

P.S: You can actually use the tab and enter keys to play the entire game!
