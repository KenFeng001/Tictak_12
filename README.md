# Computing 2 Coursework Submission.
**CID**: [02286995]

Hi, this is a game made by Zile (Ken). It's another slightly strange version of Tic-Tac-Toe.

In this game, when a player makes a move on the cell, it determines on which of the 9 main cells the next player can make their move. The ultimate goal is to win the main cell by connecting 3 of them. 

Hope you will enjoy this game！

P.S: You can actually use the tab and enter keys to play the entire game!

This template relies on a a few packages from the Node Package Manager, npm.
To install them run the following commands in the terminal.
```properties
npm install
```
These won't be uploaded to your repository because of the `.gitignore`.
I'll run the same commands when I download your repos.

### Game Module – API
*You will produce an API specification, i.e. a list of function names and their signatures, for a Javascript module that represents the state of your game and the operations you can perform on it that advances the game or provides information.*

- [ ] Include a `.js ` module file in `/web-app` containing the API using `jsdoc`.
- [ ] Update `/jsdoc.json` to point to this module in `.source.include` (line 7)
- [ ] Compile jsdoc using the run configuration `Generate Docs`
- [ ] Check the generated docs have compiled correctly.

### Game Module – Implementation
*You will implement, in Javascript, the module you specified above. Such that your game can be simulated in code, e.g. in the debug console.*

- [ ] The file above should be fully implemented.

### Unit Tests – Specification
*For the Game module API you have produced, write a set of unit tests descriptions that specify the expected behaviour of one aspect of your API, e.g. you might pick the win condition, or how the state changes when a move is made.*

- [ ] Write unit test definitions in `/web-app/tests`.
- [ ] Check the headings appear in the Testing sidebar.

### Unit Tests – Implementation
*Implement in code the unit tests specified above.*

- [ ] Implement the tests above.

### Web Application
*Produce a web application that allows a user to interface with your game module.*

- Implement in `/web-app`
  - [ ] `index.html`
  - [ ] `default.css`
  - [ ] `main.js`
  - [ ] Any other files you need to include.

### Finally
